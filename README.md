# PartyReInvite
By Kimaenaro
World of Warcraft 1.12 AddOn for reinvites while powerleveing

## Features
- **Auto re-invite** after party leave  
- **Countdown timer** before re-inviting  
- **Invite whitelisting** (only accept from specified player)  
- **Player notifications** about re-invites  

## Powerleveling Mechanics

**How to use**:  
	- **Go to settings on both characters to enable addon and auto-accepting invites, also set player names**
	- **High-level (tank) and low-level (trainee) enter dungeon together**
	- **Tank gathers mobs while maintaining aggro via healing/shouts (dont deal any damage)**
	- **Trainee tag mobs with damage (better to use explosives or aoe spell)**
	- **Tank can leave party and start kiling mobs, it will be re-invited back (in 50 sec by default) and can leave party again if any mobs left to kill**
