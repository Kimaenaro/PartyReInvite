# PartyReInvite
By Kimaenaro
World of Warcraft 1.12 AddOn for reinvites while powerleveing

## Features
- **Auto re-invite** after party leave  
- **Countdown timer** before re-inviting  
- **Invite whitelisting** (only accept from specified player)  
- **Player notifications** about re-invites  

## Powerleveling Mechanics

**How to use**:  
	- Go to settings via minimap icon (or /pri settings) on both characters to enable addon and auto-accepting invites, also set player names     
	- High-level (tank) and low-level (trainee) enter dungeon together    
	- Tank gathers mobs while maintaining aggro via healing/shouts (dont deal any damage)    
	- Trainee tag mobs with damage (better to use explosives or aoe spell)    
	- Tank can leave party and start kiling mobs, it will be re-invited back (in 50 sec by default) and can leave party again if any mobs left to kill    

**Also:**    
 	- You can invite player back before timer end by clicking button "NOW" under timer    
	- You can cancel invite timer but ctrl+click on minimap icon or /pri timer cancel
